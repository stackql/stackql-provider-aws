  /AssumeDecoratedRoleWithSAML:
    post:
      operationId: AssumeDecoratedRoleWithSAML
      description: |-
        Allows a caller to assume an IAM role decorated as the SAML user specified in the SAML assertion included in the request. This decoration allows Lake Formation to enforce access policies against the SAML users and groups. This API operation requires SAML federation setup in the caller’s account as it can only be called with valid SAML assertions. Lake Formation does not scope down the permission of the assumed role. All permissions attached to the role via the SAML federation setup will be included in the role session.

        This decorated role is expected to access data in Amazon S3 by getting temporary access from Lake Formation which is authorized via the virtual API `GetDataAccess`. Therefore, all SAML roles that can be assumed via `AssumeDecoratedRoleWithSAML` must at a minimum include `lakeformation:GetDataAccess` in their role policies. A typical IAM policy attached to such a role would look as follows:

      description: |-
        Registers the resource as managed by the Data Catalog.

        To add or update data, Lake Formation needs read/write access to the chosen data location. Choose a role that you know has permission to do this, or choose the AWSServiceRoleForLakeFormationDataAccess service-linked role. When you register the first Amazon S3 path, the service-linked role and a new inline policy are created on your behalf. Lake Formation adds the first path to the inline policy and attaches it to the service-linked role. When you register subsequent paths, Lake Formation adds the path to the existing policy.

        The following request registers a new location and gives Lake Formation permission to use the service-linked role to access that location.

        `ResourceArn = arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/ UseServiceLinkedRole = true`

        If `UseServiceLinkedRole` is not set to true, you must provide or set the `RoleArn`:

        `arn:aws:iam::12345:role/my-data-access-role`
